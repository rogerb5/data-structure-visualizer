# What is needed to run our software

One of the requirements is that you need an IDE such as VsCode, for example
installed with live server in order to lauch the project on a local host web server.

Additionally, a firebase account is needed with an authentication database, and a realtime database
so all the created users are tracked in the authentication base. The realtime database keeps
track of the checklist in the dashboard page.

To showcase the code snippets found in the information tabs of each data structure the prism.css 
library should be called in order to render syntax properly. [Prism library](https://prismjs.com/)

The assets included for this project are the images of the data structures which are used in the home 
page. And the fonts for each specific page. 

This project does not include any frameworks so no external downloadeds are neeeded.
All the code was created using plain JavaScript.
